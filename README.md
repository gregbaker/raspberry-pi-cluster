# Raspberry Pi Hadoop Cluster

Have you always wanted your very own fantastically-slow compute cluster? Then you have come to the right place.

This code will automatically (or as automatically as possible) configure a collection of [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) as a [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/)

## Instructions

In this repo, you'll find a [parts list](PARTS.md) and [setup instructions](SETUP.md).

## Why?

Why not?

In my case, as a teaching tool: it's all well and good to read in the docs that HDFS and YARN will heal themselves if a node fails. It's another to see it actually happen. When I learned that the ops staff were not thrilled about the "go into the server room and unplug things" approach, a collection of Pis was the answer.
